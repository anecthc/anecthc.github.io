          <div id="text2">&nbsp;The Greek diet is an important part of the Mediterranean cuisine and has something in common with the traditional cuisine of Italy, the Balkans, Turkey and the Levant.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although each country has its own range of food and culinary traditions, many recipes are similar in terms of ingredients and nutritional value.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greek gastronomic identity is rich and deeply rooted in time. Greece has one of the oldest gastronomic traditions in the world. It's a tradition of flavours, materials and styles that goes from prehistory to the present. In every Greek recipe, the combination of fresh ingredients and culinary techniques is a very interesting gastronomic journey into the history of Greece.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vegetables, olive oil, granola, fish, wine, and meat are commonly used in modern Greek cuisine. Other important products are olives, cheese, eggplant, zucchini, and yogurt. The main characteristics of Greek sweets are nuts and honey, while various fruits are often used. The latter are the basic material for the production of the so-called spoon sweets.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect of Greek cuisine is the appetizers, also known as "mezedes", a timeless name known around the world. Mention a traditional selection of side dishes usually served in taverns and restaurants with wine, ouzo or tsipouro.
