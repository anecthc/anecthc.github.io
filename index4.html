      <h2>The city is situated in ancient Emathia west of the ancient Macedonian town of Mieza and the site of ancient School of Aristotle.</h2>
      <p>The area, according to Herodotus, was where the fertile Gardens of King Midas were situated. Later, in the current position of the city, the Romans established the colony of Nova Augusta.
      The name changed through the centuries to Niagusta, Niaousta and Niaousa, until it became today's Naousa. It was known as "Ağustos" during Ottoman rule.</p>
      <p>In 1705, an armatolos named Zisis Karademos led a Greek uprising against the local Ottoman garrison.</p>
      <p>In 1822, during the Greek War of Independence, the fighting in Central Macedonia against the Turks came to a dramatic finale in Naousa. Abdul Abud, the Pasha of Thessaloniki, arrived on 14 March at the head of a 16,000 strong force and 12 cannons. The Greeks defended Naousa with a force of 4,000 under Anastasios Karatasos, Dimitrios Karatasos, Aggelis Gatsos, Karamitsos and Philippos, the son of Zafeirakis Theodosiou, under the overall command of Zafeirakis Theodosiou and Anastasios Karatasos.
        The Turks attempted to take the town of Naousa on 16 March, and again on 18 and 19 March, without success.</p>
        <p> On 24 March the Turks began a bombardment of the city walls that lasted for several days. After requests for the town's surrender were dismissed by the Greeks, the Turks charged the Gate of St George on Good Friday, 31 March. The Turkish attack failed but on 6 April, after receiving fresh reinforcements of some 3,000 men, the Turkish army finally overcame the Greek resistance and entered the city.
        In an infamous incident, as the rebels were abandoning the town, some of the women left behind committed suicide by falling down a cliff over the small river Arapitsa. Zafeirakis Theodosiou was pursued by a Turkish unit and was killed. The other Greek leaders retreated southwards. Abdul Abud laid the town and surrounding area to waste.</p>
        <p>The fall and massacre of Naousa marked the end of the Greek Revolution in Central Macedonia. A notable survivor of the incident was Greek American refugee Gregory Anthony Perdicaris.</p>

          <p>Naoussa is a destination for nature lovers, surrounded by fields producing peaches, apples, cherries and the red wine variety of “Xinomavro”.</p>
          <p>The mountains of Vermio are an unexplored area with lot of paths perfect for walking, hiking and biking tours.
          On the slopes of Naoussa you can visit historical places like the school of Aristotle and the famous Macedonian tombs with some of the finest Hellenistic painting examples. The lush greenery watered by nearby springs held a shrine dedicated to the Nymphs.</p>
          <p>Naoussa is know for the red dry wine variety “Xinomavro”. It is home of some of the best wineries in Greece and a popular wine region all year round. Vineyard cultivation and wine-making in this area date back to the 16th century.
          The unique microclimate of this region and the great wine making expertise helps the creation of some of the most refined red wines in Greece. The PDO (Protected Designated Origin) area in Naoussa was established in 1971.</p>

                <p>During the Ottoman Empire and Turkish occupation which lasted until 1912 in some areas, people in Naoussa turned to Boules in order to frame and accept through mocking and risky resistance their enslavement to the Turks and ultimately find joy in the paradox of being Christian and descendant of an ancient pagan God.</p>
